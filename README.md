<h1>ExpNo 2 : Implement Depth First Search Traversal of a Graph</h1> 
<h3>Name: RHISHON D V S</h3>

<H3>Aim:</H3>
<p> To Implement Depth First Search Traversal of a Graph using Python 3.</p>
<h3>Theory:</h3>
<strong>Depth First Traversal </strong>(or DFS) for a graph is like Depth First Traversal of a tree. The only catch here is that, unlike trees, graphs may contain cycles (a node may be visited twice). Use a Boolean visited array to avoid processing a node more than once. A graph can have more than one DFS traversal. 
Depth-first search is an algorithm for traversing or searching trees or graph data structures. The algorithm starts at the root node (selecting some arbitrary node as the root node in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
Step 1: Initially, stack and visited arrays are empty.

Queue and visited arrays are empty initially.

Stack and visited arrays are empty initially.

Step 2: Visit 0 and put its adjacent nodes which are not visited yet into the stack.

 Visit node 0 and put its adjacent nodes (1, 2, 3) into the stack
 
 Visit node 0 and put its adjacent nodes (1, 2, 3) into the stack

Step 3: Now, Node 1 at the top of the stack, so visit node 1 and pop it from the stack and put all of its adjacent nodes which are not visited in the stack.

Visit node 1

Visit node 1

Step 4: Now, Node 2 at the top of the stack, so visit node 2 and pop it from the stack and put all of its adjacent nodes which are not visited (i.e, 3, 4) in the stack.

 Visit node 2 and put its unvisited adjacent nodes (3, 4) into the stack
 
 Visit node 2 and put its unvisited adjacent nodes (3, 4) into the stack

Step 5: Now, Node 4 at the top of the stack, so visit node 4 and pop it from the stack and put all of its adjacent nodes which are not visited in the stack.

 Visit node 4
 Visit node 4

Step 6: Now, Node 3 at the top of the stack, so visit node 3 and pop it from the stack and put all of its adjacent nodes which are not visited in the stack.

Visit node 3
Visit node 3

Now, the Stack becomes empty, which means we have visited all the nodes, and our DFS traversal ends.

# Program:
```
# DFS using Stack (Iterative) - Input Format Based

def dfs(graph, start):
    visited = set()
    stack = [start]
    result = []

    while stack:
        node = stack.pop()
        if node not in visited:
            visited.add(node)
            result.append(node)

            # Add neighbors in reverse order to maintain correct DFS order
            for neighbor in reversed(graph[node]):
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    stack.append(neighbor)

    return result


# -------------------------
# MAIN PROGRAM
# -------------------------

# Read number of nodes and edges
n, e = map(int, input().split())

graph = {}

# Build graph dictionary
for _ in range(e):
    u, v = input().split()

    if u not in graph:
        graph[u] = []
    if v not in graph:
        graph[v] = []

    graph[u].append(v)
    # If undirected graph, also add reverse
    # graph[v].append(u)

# Choose starting node (first node in graph)
start_node = list(graph.keys())[0]

# Perform DFS
output = dfs(graph, start_node)
print(output)
```
